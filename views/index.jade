    | Before you is a list of urls that I've visited the past week or so.
    | The darker the color, the more often I go to the site. If I'm currently
    | browsing, you'll see updates in real-time to give you an idea of what I'm
    | up to. However, much like my memory, urls will be forgotten after a week
    | of no use. Hover to see, click to view.
